## Getting Started

To try out Doclin, install extension in VS Code. [Link to VS Code Marketplace.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Doclin.doclin)

Currently only supports VS Code, but to be extended to other IDEs once we validate the concept.

## What is Doclin?

### Purpose

The purpose of this tool is to build code knowledgebase easily. Traditional code documentation methods is very inefficient. Writing code and documentation at the same time often resulted docs to be redundant, of no real-value, time-consuming and it quickly got out-of-date. We believe it is more helpful to document the answers when someone asks a question or faces a problem. This not only ensures the documentation is more meaningful, but we can spend less time in writing documentation.

Doclin is still in very early-stage. If you like the idea, please show support my star-ring this repository!

### Usage

1. Ask questions on code from your IDE!\

2. Get answers in real-time.\

3. Discussions stay coupled with the code.\

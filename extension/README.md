# Doclin for VS Code

Doclin is a modern way of commenting on a codebase. It is built for software developer teams dealing with complex systems.

We are continuously improving, please leave us some feedback - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeBWV7a1XwfTXvrTLAdb8vijr3_JzbPQtnGqlJAuohTzz63ag/viewform

### With doclin,

1. **No need to leave your IDE to ask a question on a complex piece of code**.\
If you come across a code that raises questions, simply select the code and tag your team member on doclin and ask the question. Your question and answer will stay coupled with the code that anyone can view at any time.

2. **No longer need inline comments**.\
Inline comments are messy and get easily outdated. They are often redundant and _not useful when explaining difficult business logic._ Instead, leverage doclin's rich text editor and thread system, to seamlessly discuss and provide detailed comments on complex business-specific code in real-time.

3. **Prevent questions that are already answered**.\
Any questions asked on a particular piece of code stay coupled to the code in doclin. So whenever you pull up a tangly source code you may come across threads that already answer your questions.

4. **Prevent unclean code from resurfacing**.\
If you ever come across some unclean code, just leave a comment and suggest a better alternative, this will save future devs from repeating the same pitfalls.

# Doclin is super easy to set up

1. Install the extension in VS Code.
2. Open a folder or a file where you want to leave a comment. To get the most out of doclin's productivity, use a git repo.
3. Open doclin extension from the left activity bar.
4. If you are using doclin for the first time, you will be asked to create an organization and project. This will create a `.doclin` file in your directory - push it to git and all your teammates will be able to collaborate with you on doclin. You can invite new members by sending an invitation from the invite button. 
5. You are ready to use doclin!

# It is even easier to add a comment

1. Open a file on vscode with doclin installed.
2. Highlight a piece of code and click 'Add Comment'. There are three ways to add a comment:
    - Use the 'Add Comment' button on the bottom-left status bar.
    - Or, right-click on vscode and click 'Add Comment'.
    - Or, use 'CTRL + SHIFT + P' and type in 'Add Comment'.
3. If you want to mention your teammates, type in `@` and their names on the editor.
4. Hit 'Submit'. The mentioned users will be notified through their email.

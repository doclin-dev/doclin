# Doclin for VS Code - Collaborate Like Never Before!

Doclin real-time commenting and discussion tool designed for improve code knowledgebase. Traditional code documentation methods is very inefficient. Writing code and documentation at the same time often resulted docs to be redundant, of no real-value, time-consuming and it quickly got out-of-date. We believe it is more helpful to document the answers when someone asks a question or faces a problem. This not only ensures the documentation is more meaningful, but we can spend less time in writing documentation.

Doclin is still in very early-stage. If you like the idea, please show support my star-ring this on [github](https://github.com/doclin-dev/doclin)!

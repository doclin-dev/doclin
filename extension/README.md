# Doclin for VS Code

Doclin is a modern way of commenting on a codebase. It is built for large software developer teams dealing with complex systems.

### With doclin,

1. **You don't need to leave your IDE to ask a question on a piece of code**.\
If you come across a code that raises questions, simply tag your team member on doclin and ask the question. Your question and answer you received will stay coupled with the code which anyone can view at any time.

2. **You no longer need inline comments**.\
Inline comments are messy and get easily outdated. They are often redundant where an explanation is not necessary and often not useful when explaining difficult business logic. You can use doclin's rich text editor and thread-reply system that everyone loves to leave comments on your code in real-time.

3. **You will not waste time on problems that have been solved before**. \
Any questions asked on a particular piece of code stay coupled to the code in doclin. So whenever you pull up a tangly source code you may come across threads that already answer your question.

4. **You can prevent unclean code from reoccurring in the future**.\
If you ever come across some unclean code your colleagues have written and if you want future devs to not copy-paste these? Simply leave a comment on that, suggest a better alternative and you are good to go!

# Doclin is super easy to set up

1. Install the extension in VS Code.
2. Open a folder or a file where you want to leave a comment. To get the most out of doclin's productivity, use a git repo.
3. Open doclin extension from the left activity bar.
4. If you are using doclin for the first time, you will be asked to create an organization and project. This will create a .doclin file in your directory - push it to git and all your teammates will be able to collaborate with you on doclin.
5. You are ready to use doclin!

# It is even easier to add a comment

1. Open a file on vscode with doclin installed.
2. Highlight a piece of code and click 'Add Comment.' There are three ways add a comment:
    - Use the "Add Comment" button on the bottom-left status bar.
    - Or, right-click on vscode and click 'Add Comment.'
    - Or, use 'CTRL + SHIFT + P' and type in 'Add Comment.'
3. If you want to mention your teammates, type in '@' and their names on the editor.
4. Hit 'Submit.'
